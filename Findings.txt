1. We do not need to scaled values in case of decision tree regressor
2. max_depth could control overfitting in dt regressor.
3. try grid_search or randomize search for cross validation and finding
best parameters
4. Dt could perform well on small datasets
5. You can train regression model with categorical vlaues
but if we have ordinal categories we should use labelencoder other wise
one hot encoding
